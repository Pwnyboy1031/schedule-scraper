# schedule-scraper

This is a personal project I built to automatically add my work schedule to my google calendar. 
I found it to be a pain to login every time to find out my schedule and manually add it to my google calendar. This was my solution.
I've used it several times, however, unfortunately/fortunately my employer has moved away from their scheduling software so it no longer works. However, I wanted to share it with the credentials and tokens removed.
